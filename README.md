# Desktop Quiz App

**Desktop Quiz App** is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to test their knowledge of various programming languages through multiple-choice quizzes. Built using `java.awt` and `javax.swing`, this app offers an interactive and educational experience.

## Features
- Select from multiple programming languages (C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, etc.).
- Each quiz consists of 10 multiple-choice questions.
- Timer functionality to track time for each quiz session.
- Intuitive navigation with **Next**, **Previous**, and **Submit** buttons.
- Results display at the end of each quiz.

## Technology Used
- **Java** (Swing and AWT libraries)
- **Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **AWT** for creating UI components and handling events.

## How It Works
1. **Language Selection**: The user selects a programming language from the list (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.).
2. **Timed Quiz**: Once the quiz starts, the user is presented with 10 questions, one at a time. A timer counts down, adding a challenge to complete the quiz within a limited time.
3. **Navigation**: Users can move through the quiz using **Next** and **Previous** buttons.
4. **Submit**: After answering the questions, users can submit their quiz to view the results.
